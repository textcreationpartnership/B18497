            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:206439:3"/> Fishes of the Sea, and the Fowls of the Air, and every Creature moving therein; save onely of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, he was not to eat: Now the Serpent being more subtil, then all the Beasts of the field did insinuate if self into the affections of the woman, and having got room in the weaker Vessel, did induce both the man and the woman through feigned smoothes words (and not by direct opposition, mark that) into disobedience to the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, whose image they then lost, by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents transformation; who raised the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, aspiring, self-seeking principle, that desired to be equal with God, which they soon received, and obeyed; thereby losing the happy, blessed, and good estate in which he was placed, and thereby fell into the knowledge of Evil, and naked miserable estate with God, being trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the image of the Serpent, was captivated in the Curse, and so came to be driven out of the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> (in which he was placed) and to be fenced out from the Tree of Life, and from the Presence of the Lord in that state for ever.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:206439:3"/>
            <p>And because the Serpent had done this, the Lord cursed it above all Cattel, and every Beast of the Field, and put enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between its seed, and the Seed of the woman, saying, <hi>The Womans Seed shall break its Head, and it should bruise his Heel;</hi> so the Enmity being placed between the Seeds, the warfare was begun, which ever since hath continued through the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of mankind; and hence the striving between the Twins in the womb comes to be known; and the Elected and Reprobated Seed is known; and the Seed of the Bond-woman, and the Seed of the Free-woman is known; and the Fleshly Birth persecuting that which is born of the Spirit is known; and the Promise of the Lord to the Seed of the woman is known, and fulfilled in those that witness the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord from Heaven to be come; and the Seed of the Covenant is known to such, in which all the Nations of the Earth is blessed; and blessed and happy are they that are apprehended, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes in this Seed, for they shall again come to eat of the Tree of Life, that is in the midst of the Paradice of God, and their names shall be written in the Book
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:206439:4"/> of the Life of the Lamb, from henceforth and for ever.</p>
            <p>It being my aim and intent at this time to present unto publick view, and to the manifested Light, and Judgment of all pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and sober men, not onely my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, state, and condition from my child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but rather my estate and condition in Spirit, in all the gentle leadings, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and carryings on of my soul, by the Lord, from the day of the dispensation of the tender Mercy and Love of God, (by his Light dispensed, and made known in me) unto this present day of my suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his Name and Gospel; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to give a Relation of the ground and cause of my Sufferings, the Person by whom, and the manner how, with a bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate of my Testimony, and Judgment in the matters of this Treatise, in as much brevity as possible, whereby to clear my Conscience (and answer the witness in others) in the sight of God.</p>
            <p>AS for my discent (to speak after the manner of men) I sprang of mean (though honest) Parents according to the flesh, my Father being a Husbandman in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:206439:4"/> the County of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> I (according to his pleasure) was educated sometimes at School, sometime with Herding, and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sheep, or Cattel, sometime with the Plow, Cart, or Threshing-Instrument, or other lawfull Labours, according to the manner of that part of the County in which I lived; yet such was the Love and tender Mercy of the Lord, (who alwayes had respect unto the meek and lowly in heart, and dwells with the contrite and humble in spirit, and shews kindness and mercy to them of low degree) that he was pleased to visit me with his everlasting Love, which often presented unto me my state and manner of life, and by the same Love and Light he made known unto me, that his Way and Worship was a purer, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier Way, and cleaner Life, then yet I had attained unto, and withal gave me to see the evils, and miserable effects of that state and condition in which I lived according to the Fashions, Customs, Wayes and Worships of the formal World, which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret drawings I felt time after time (as a small still voice behind my back) observe this, inwardly calling for righteousness, and holiness of life, and as it were, saying,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:206439:5"/>
               <hi>This is the Way, walk in it;</hi> read your own, for thus I was induced to seek after the Lord, and to make further enquiry into the Way of God; (out of which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my self) and then not knowing where the Lord was to be found, nor that it was he that stirred, and drew by his Love in me; I gave my self to reading and searching of the Scriptures, which was then preached (by the man-made Ministers, and also generally believed by the people they taught) to be the Word of God, and the alone way to the Kingdom, and to the knowledge of God, his Way, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; and believing their Doctrines, I did with much diligence and zeal press after the knowledge of the Scriptures, giving up my self to hear Sermons, learn Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms, and the like, after the manner and general practise taught by the then Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, sometime more strickt then the rest, whose comliness seemed to transcend the precedent Generation of Priests, and their way of worship; yet it pleased the Lord not onely inwardly to break my rest in spirit, but also outwardly to afflict me with bodily afflictions, for I was afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from my youth up, and from my child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:206439:5"/> the rod of correction was upon me inwardly and outwardly; inwardly known to my self alone, and outwardly apparent to most, or all that knew me after the flesh; some concluding I was in a Consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, some in one disease, some in another; and then by the advice and will of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (according to the Flesh) I sought to (and proved) many Doctors and Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, for the restoration of the health of my body; but they (like the Priests) were all Physicians of no value, for none did remove the cause, nor take away the effect, which still remained with me, and upon me, as a motive spur, or whip, to drive me forward to get an interest in the Lord, who through the riches of his Love did spiritually apply my bodily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions for the health and Salvation of my soul, inwardly drawing my affections and desires after him, still presenting to my view, and raising in my understanding a Way more holy, and pure, and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his Will, then the way I was in, drawing me from one degree of Grace to another, and from one Dispensation to another, according to his good pleasure and will; then I began to affect those (that

Weigh these things with thy practise; Why shouldst

Or where hast thou any such rule in it amongst all the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of the Saints? And do not think but thou must be brought before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of God, there to give an account of all thy deeds done in thy body, and there thy Person will have no more respect then mine, (though now it may) all thy pomp, thy dignity and riches will stand thee in no stead, neither justifie thee in his sight, who hath said, <hi>The Wicked shall not go unpunished;</hi> thou hast deprived me of my just Liberty already, and if that cannot content or satisfie thee, surely no more will mine Estate; for the more thou obeyest that envious and covetous spirit, the more it will draw thee on, until thy soul be shut up in the Grave, out of which there is no redemption. So I desire thee, have respect to thy Souls everlasting health, for these, and such like as thou art often found in, are not the fruits of a Gospel Minister, for Christ and his Apostles never taught any such Doctrine; and truly, whilst thou art of this spirit and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thy Ministry will not profit towards

                  <p>But thou may object and say, there is a reason, thou hast a proper right and due unto it; To this I answer, (as I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done) if thou or any of thy Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will appoint the time and place where I, or some other of my Companions in bonds may meet with you, and according to Scripture, sound Doctrine, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth convince me or us that such things is just and due, and properly belong to your Ministration, or that Christ and his Apostles did ordain constitute or allow any such Ministry or Maintenance after he had offered himself a perfect Sacrifice, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thereby abolished all Types, and the Law that made nothing perfect: I say, if thou, or any of you can, or will convince me or us of the lawfulness of paying Tythes, we should neither suffer Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, loss of Estate, or Goods, nor the Execution of any Law to pass upon us for denial of Tythes, but rather pay them as conscientiously as any one whatsoever: And this were but the place &amp; duty of your Function, and indeed, if it were not matter of Conscience to me, I could not have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered such detriment, loss and imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the patience and content as I have

            <p>In my first I desired (as I would often have willingly imbraced) that he, or any other of his Function and Profession would give me or us a sober moderate visit or meeting, at their own time and place, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing us person for person, that there we might dispute the differences in Religion between them and us, in a sober moderate spirit, which to us is of great price; and if in the Spirit of meekness he or they could convince us, that we are schismatical and erroneous, &amp;c. (as they have frequently affirmed, and preached behind our backs) whether in denying of Tythes, or in any other thing whatsoever; I can say it for my self, and believe it for many others, that if in our Consciences we were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereof, we would reform our Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and pay Tythes, and submit in any other thing whatsoever, as really and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously as any people in the Nation,

W. hath oft preached, it may be known, to whom the Lord hath given the Urim and the Thummim; but these they use but in words only, but instead of dealing so with us, they'l turn us over to a Consistory, Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Court, (so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) which, as I may truly say is as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Earthly a corrupt Court at this day, as any in the world I know of) and to the Secular Powers, and Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, &amp;c. and when we are brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and answers to what is charged against us, pleading matters of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Doctrine of Christ or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, or the Priviledge of the Church in a

So ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sword by their thigh, and the Law by their side, thus are we preyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by every one of them; and if any one do plead himself free by their Law, then (as some of them hath said) they know what to do, they have another bait to catch us with, which they know will hold, and that is, tender us an Oath, and because we will not swear like themselves, then either fine or imprison, or banish, &amp;c. and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got us into Prisons for Tythes, or such things, there they let us lie as dead men out of mind, never owning nor regarding us in any thing from year to year, unless to envy and straiten our Liberty, &amp;c. by stirring up and provoking the Goalers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, who being willing to do the Priests and Magistrates a favour, hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten shown their severity, to the hazard

            <p>And also whether it were not requisite that he gave me a true &amp; particular account of every of his demands and claims what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever or of any other difference (if any had been) betwixt us, before he had thus far proceeded to have damnified me, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done what in him lay, to deprive me of all, save only my life, which I have yet for a prey? And also whether it had not been his place and duty, pretending to be a Teacher and Instructer of others, a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister and Pastor, or Elder in the Church; being reputed a Learned Orthodoxical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine? (and sometime professing himself my spiritual father) but such measure as I have had from him are no spiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions to me) I say, if so, whether he ought not to have answered my Queries, and also my other Papers sent to him;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:206439:35"/> (which he never would do to this day) thereby to have informed and cleared my judgment and understanding, being things appertaining to Faith and Religion, and the Profession and Worship of Christianity, and so matters of Conscience to me, let all sober wise men judge?</p>
            <p>Also, I shall appeal unto all sober and conscientious men and women, and refer my self to the Witness of God, and the illuminated understanding in all, whether ever any of the Holy men of God did so with any person in the Church, or out of the Church, Believer or Infidel, as he hath done with me, yea, or nay? or whether ever you read of any of the Apostles or Ministers of Christ in Ages past that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to give a reason of their Faith and Hope in Christ Jesus; and to instruct, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, inform, teach, reprove, rebuke, &amp;c. as he hath done? or whether you read of any Ministers of Christ that sued at Law for the maintenance of their Bellies, spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and persecuted, excommunicated out of their Church into Prison, sought mens Liberty, Heritage and Estate, and yet can shew no fair nor just cause, as he hath done, yea, or nay?

All which, (with several such like deeds, which I shall now omit) I need not go far to prove, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own practice doth notoriously evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and testifie the same, sufficiently known to many that knows both him and me, and by what is before related.</p>
            <p>Now considering the many Disputes, Contentions, Strifes, suing at Law, spoiling of Goods, casting into Prisons, and the great unparalell'd sufferings that have been occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned in this Nation in these late years about Tythes, and the great objections and exclamations made against us for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them, (about which I have a share, being deeply concerned and involved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) together, for the quietness and peace of my spirit, upon which this thing hath long rested, excites me to cast in my mite, and lay down my reasons and grounds whereupon I have denied them, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for the non-payment thereof; though
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:206439:36"/> the weakest and unfitest of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands for such a work; yet, according to what I have received, and am perswaded of, I shall lay down in truth and simplicity; and that chiefly for the satisfaction of such as desire to be satisfied, and for the stopping the many objections and maledictions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers made in secret behind my back by some of my Neighbours, especially the people cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Independants</hi> in that part, who most of any hath condemned me for suffering so much for such small trivial matters, as they say, being as it seems a small scruple in their Consciences, and such a mote as they can easily swallow now, though in the beginning rise and growth of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, their Judgment was wholly against Tythes in a Gospel day; yea, some of them preaching in great zeal against them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the institution of them, saying, <hi>They were clear contrary to the maintenance of a Gospel Ministry;</hi> and yet when they saw that Tythes were like to be the only wages, maintenance and reward of their preaching; (being generally established by the Laws and Cannons of <hi>England</hi> for that end) rather then they would want that sweet morsel, and goodly garment,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:206439:36"/> and the fleshly ease that came thereby, and suffer any thing for the denying of the same, they could soon (through their Christian prudence or policy) cure that Malady; and for the better digestion of that Diet, make to themselves a stomack Pill, or two, to cure that crudity; and so rather suppress, extirpate, hide, or let fall one of their Principles, then either want that delightsome livelihood, or beloved Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifice, or yet either suffer any thing either in liberty or estate for the holding that Principle throughout.</p>
            <p>So for the considerations aforesaid, I shall endeavour to answer the general Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections principly made against me and my Brethren in this case, and what I hold and believe concerning them.</p>
            <p n="1">1st <hi>Objection,</hi> is, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s returning from <hi>Chedarlaomer</hi> from rescuing his Nephew <hi>Lot, Melehisedeck</hi> met him, and blessed him, and blessed the Lord in his behalf, and brought forth Bread and Wine and set before him, &amp;c. and to him <hi>Abraham</hi> gave a Tenth of the Spoils, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.18. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> To this I say, I never find it a president or rule for me; suppose he gave
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:206439:37"/> a Tenth, it was a voluntary gift, he was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commanded by God, nor compelled by man, and if he had not given, I think he had not sinned, and that which he did give was but a Tenth of the Spoils, taken at the victory, and so no rule for me, being no Souldier at any such slaughter, and so not partaker of any such spoils; so if it be binding to any, (as I think to none) it is to Souldiers, and not to Plowmen: and what if he in gratification of his love (in meeting him, and setting Bread and Wine before him) had given him one half of the Spoils, this had been no binding rule to Posterity.</p>
            <p n="2">2d <hi>Objection,</hi> is, <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Vow when he went to <hi>Padan-aram: If God,</hi> said he, <hi>will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my Fathers house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God, and this stone my pillow, which I have set for a pillar, shall be Gods house; and of all that thou givest me, I will surely give a Tenth unto thee,</hi> Gen. 28.20.</p>

And he awaked, and said, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not; and he was afraid, saying, How dreadfull is this place, it is none other but the House of God, this is the Gate of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Now in <hi>Exodus</hi> 23.19. it is said, <hi>The first of the First-fruits of the Land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God.</hi> This is the first express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but here is no certain dividual part expressed, only the first of the First-fruits, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.26.</p>

            <p>Again, that which is more express is <hi>Levit.</hi> 27.30, 32, 33. <hi>All the Tythe of the Land, both of the Seed of the Ground, and of the Trees is the Lords; and every tythe of Bullock and Sheep, and all that goeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord;</hi> this is a more positive command then any before.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.20. it is said, <hi>Ye shall offer a Cake of the first of your Dough for an Heave-offering; as the Heave-offering of the Barn ye shall lift it up, and give it to the Lord in your Generations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Moses</hi> being the Son of a <hi>Levite, Exod.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Aaron</hi> was his Brother, chap. 4.14. the Lord bids <hi>Moses</hi> separate <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons for the Priests Office, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.1. and appoints him to make them holy Garments, <hi>The Ephod and the curious Girdle,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Aaron</hi> was to wear the Brest-plate of Judgment upon his Heart, and upon it the names of the Children of

            <p>And <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons was to have no Inheritance in the Land▪ neither any part among the children of <hi>Israel;</hi> for the Lord was their part and Inheritance for ever, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.1, 2. And to the Children of <hi>Levi</hi> the Lord gave the Tenth in <hi>Israel,</hi> for their Inheritance, and for their Service

            <p>Then again, I read <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.28, 29. beside the Tythe they were to bring year by year unto the Lord, at the end of every three year they were to bring forth all the Tythe of their increase, and lay it up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Gates, and thither should the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> come, (because they had no Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among them) and the Strangers, the Fatherless, and the Widows, and should eat and be filled, that the Lord might bless <hi>Israel</hi> in all the works of their hands, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.12, 13, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Then again, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> when he came he saw the House of God was forsaken, and the Portion of the <hi>Levites</hi> had not been given, but every one was fled to his own Land; he reproved the Rulers, and set the <hi>Levites</hi> in their places, and caused all <hi>Judah</hi> to bring their Tythe of Corn, and Wine, and Oyl into the Treasuries, &amp;c. and appointed the Wards of the Priests, and of the <hi>Levites</hi> every one in his Office, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.10, 11, 12, 30, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Also King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> appointed the Courses of the Priests and Levites by their turns, every man according to his Office, (hence it is said <hi>Zacharias</hi> was of the Course of <hi>Abia,</hi> and executed the Priests Office before God as his turn came, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 5.8.) and commanded the People to bring in part for the Priests and Levites, that they might be encouraged in the Law of the Lord; So the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> brought in abundance of First-fruits, Corn, Wine,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:206439:41"/> Oyl and Hony, and of the increase of the Field, and the Tythes of Bullocks, Sheep, and of the holy and consecrated things; the Tythe of all things in abundance: yea, so much, as they eat and were satisfied, and there was many heaps laid up in store; and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> commanded them to build Chambers, and in them they laid up all their Tythe, and their First-fruits, and their dedicated things, and set Overseers over them, to whom they committed the charge of them, who destributed with fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to their Brethren great and small by course, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31.2, 4, 5, 6. to vers. 14. &amp;c.

            <p>Then, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> setting forth the glory of the Temple, and measuring it with the measuring Reed, he shews who shall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the service of the Temple, and who not; he also divided the Land into

Christs own words, saying, <hi>Wo unto you Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, ye tythe Mint and Rue, and all manner of Herbs, and neglect and pass over Judgment, and the Love of God; these things ye ought to have done, and not to have left the other undone.</hi> These are the main grounds (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Law of the first Covenant) upon which the Ordinations, Titles, Claims and Propriety of Tythes do, or ever did arise or spring; and upon which all the Disputes, Acts, Decrees, Laws, and Tryals at Law, Differences and Sufferings, of what kind soever, do origionally arise and descend, by which the Reader may observe the rise and institution of Tythes, and the end thereof, and the observation of them from <hi>Moses,</hi> or the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards till Christ <hi>the end of the Law for Righteousness sake, to all them that believe,</hi> Rom. 10.4.</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:206439:43"/>
            <p>I shall now proceed to give my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whereupon I deny the payment of Tythes.</p>
            <p>First, The Reader may take notice of the Institution of Tythes, and by whom; Here is <hi>Moses</hi> the Servant and Prophet of the Lord, who was faithfull in all his House, and was a Witness through Faith of those things which should afterward come to pass, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.3, 4. this was he whom the Lord chused and sent into <hi>Egypt</hi> for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Prince, and Deliverer to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel, Exod.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.34, 35. and having brought them to <hi>Mount-Sinai,</hi> the Lord spake unto <hi>Moses,</hi> saying, <hi>Tell the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>You have seen what I did to the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>and how I have carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you on Eagles wings, and brought you to me: Now if you will hear my voice indeed, and keep my Covenant, then ye shall be my chief treasure above all people, though all the Earth be mine; and ye shall be to me a Kingdom of Priests, and an holy Nation.</hi> Then <hi>Moses</hi> proposed to them what the Lord had said to him; and the People an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered unanimously, <hi>All that the Lord hath commanded we will do:</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> reported their words unto the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.3, 4,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:206439:44"/> 5, &amp;c. So the Lord calling <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> only up into the Mount, said, <hi>I am the Lord thy God that have brought thee out of</hi> Egypt, &amp;c. <hi>Thou shalt have no other Gods besides me;</hi> and he delivered to them his Precepts and his Law by the dispensation of Angels, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. &amp;c. Also he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them not to make unto themselves gods of Silver or Gold, vers. 23. Then he commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to make an Altar of Earth, or Stone, whereon to offer the Burnt-offerings, and Peace-offerings, &amp;c. <hi>And see,</hi> saith he, <hi>that a Tool be not lifted up upon it,</hi> vers. 24, 25. Then he delivered to him the Temporal, or Civil Laws, <hi>Exod.</hi> chapters 21, 22, 23, &amp;c. So <hi>Moses</hi> wrote all the Laws, and erected them an Altar under the Mount, and Twelve Pillars, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel;</hi> and sent of the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> who offered Burnt-offerings, Beaves and Peace-offerings, &amp;c. and with half of the Blood he sprinkled the Altar, and the rest he put in Basins: And he read the Laws, and all the Words of the Lord to the People; who said, <hi>All that the Lord hath said we will do, and be obedient:</hi> So <hi>Moses</hi> sprinkled all the people with the Blood, and said,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:206439:44"/>
               <hi>Behold the Blood of the Covenant which the Lord hath made with you touching all these things,</hi> chap. 24. Then the Lord called <hi>Moses</hi> up into the Mount, saying, <hi>I will give thee Tables of Stone, and a Law, and Commandments which I have written, that thou mayst teach them to the People:</hi> And <hi>Moses</hi> took his Minister <hi>Joshua,</hi> and went up; and <hi>Moses</hi> was in the Mount forty days, and forty nights; and God speak unto <hi>Moses</hi> to speak unto the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> that they should offer unto the Lord an Offering of Gold, Silver, Brass, Purple, scarlet, and fine Linnen, Oyl, and Spices, and precious Stones, &amp;c. And that they should make the Lord a Sanctuary, that he might dwell amongst them; and that it should be according to the express Patern shewed to him: and also that he should make an Ark, in which the Testimonies of the Covenant should be placed; descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the fashion of the Tabernacle, and the order, place and fashion of all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances thereunto belonging; every thing was to be made, placed and erected according to the express Patern shewn to him in the Mount, chapters 25, 26. Mark what I say, <hi>Moses</hi> having read the Law,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:206439:45"/> and the Book of the Covenant in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the people, they said, <hi>All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient,</hi> chap. 24.7, 8. Then he took the Blood of the Covenant, having with the one half sprinkled the Altar, with the other half he sprinkled the people, and the Covenant was confirmed; for almost all things were by the Law purged with blood; <hi>and without shedding of blood is no remission, Hebr.</hi> 9.22. [Mark] here is the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the first Covenant, <hi>which stood in meats, and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal Ordinances, which was imposed until the time of Reformation,</hi> Hebr. 9.9, 10. [Mark here again] <hi>which was but a Figure for the time then present, and could never make the Comers thereunto perfect, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Conscience: But Christ being come an High Priest of good things to come,</hi> [Mark] <hi>by a greater and more perfect Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, that is not made with hands, nor not of this building.</hi> I say also, Christ Jesus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come (who was the end of the Law for Righteousness sake, to all that believe, and the Substance of all Shadows, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>types and Figures) he hath brought in a more excellent Ministry, being a Mediator
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:206439:45"/> of a better Covenant, established upon better Promises; wherefore, coming into the World, he saith, <hi>Sacrifices, Offerings and Burnt-offerings for sin, thou wouldest not,</hi> (which are offered by the Law) <hi>but a Body thou hast prepared, (as it is written) Lo I come to do thy Will O God; by the which Will we are sanctified,</hi> saith the Apostle; [Mark] <hi>He taketh away the First, that he might establish the Second;</hi> Now if the First Covenant had been faultless, there should no place have been for the Second; but finding fault with them under the First Covenant; (and why? because it was not possible that the blood of Bulls and Goats should take away sins; for in those Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices there was (yea, and is) a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of sins every year; so that the Commers thereunto is not made perfect) so finding fault with them, he saith, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the dayes come, that I will make a new Covenant with the House of</hi> Israel, <hi>and with the House of</hi> Judah, <hi>not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers when I took them by the hand, and led them out of</hi> Egypt; <hi>(for because they abode not in my Covenant, I regarded them not saith the Lord) But this is the Covenant that I will

Ezek. 37.26, &amp;c. Hebr. 8.8, 9, 10. and 10.16. <hi>They shall not need to teach every man his Neighbour, or every man his Brother, saying, Know the Lord, for they shall all know me, even from the least to the greatest of them; and their their sins &amp; their iniquities will I remember no more:</hi> [Mark] Their Sins &amp; their Iniquities will I remember no more; here suffer me to enlarge a little by the way: Now where Remission of sin is, there needs no more Offering for sin; and for this end was Christ made manifest to take away all sin, &amp; in him was no sin; howbeit the Children of Darkness, who are Strangers to the Covenant of Promise, being never yet come to the <hi>Light,</hi> nor to the <hi>Second Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> the <hi>New and Living Way;</hi> they, I say, that have not received this, they say there is no redemption from under sin; there is none, say they, can be set free from iniquity while on this side the grave; there is not an upright man upon the Earth, say they, that doth good, and sinneth not; there is none righteous, no not one: a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:206439:46"/> strange Doctrine in a Gospel Day; this Generation used to bless the Name of the Lord for this Glorious Day, and Golden Age, and time (said some) wherein his Gospel was so purely taught and preached; [Mark this confusion] Is the Gospel purely taught them, when they are yet in their sins; but it may be they have not received the Gospel in Power and Purity, but in name and word only; for the <hi>Gospel is the Power of God,</hi> Rom. 1.16. or Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus <hi>the Light of the World, the Power of God, and the Wisdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.24. <hi>who was manifested to take away sin;</hi> but these will pretend to be Gospel men, and Christians, who say none can be purified from sin, and thereby frustrate the end of the Lord, and make void his coming, who came <hi>to save his People from their sins; and he is able to save to the utmost them that come unto God by him:</hi> but, may it not be said, they come not unto God by him, and they enter not in at the Door, but climbs up some other way, that holds sin for tearm of Life, which the Devil is Author and Lord of; then whose Servants are they, let wise men judge; a smokey Tenent, a principle of Darkness assended out of the Bottomless
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:206439:47"/> Pit; sure, no Christians, what ere they may profess: What, hath Christ suffered in vain? What, hath the shedding of his Blood no more effect? What, is he not able perfectly to save those that come unto God by him? Is he not able to save his people from their sins? Is he not able to redeem from death? Is his Hand short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Or his Power weakned? Is he not the same he was in the Apostles dayes? Is not his Power the same yesterday, to day, and for ever? [Mark] Was he not given for Salvation to the Ends of the Earth? Was he not sent to redeem those that were under the Law? Was he not sent to save his people from their sins? Was he not ordained a Light to lighten the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the Glory of the People of <hi>Israel?</hi> Yea, <hi>a Light to lighten those that sit in Darkness, and the Regions of the shadow of Death, and to guide their feet in the Way of Peace:</hi> Was he not manifested to take away our sins? And was not his Blood shed for the remission of sins? the Apostle said, yes: And if it be not so that our sins be done away, nor we not sanctified, purified and clensed through his Blood, nor do not witness remission nor forgiveness through

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:206439:56"/> was lifted up upon the Cross, he said, <hi>Its finished;</hi> then he put an end to all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the First Tabernacle, and brought in the Second, the unchangeable Priesthood, which stands for ever after the order of <hi>Melchisedeck.</hi> Thus much for Tythes as they were due under the Law, and no where else, and as they were an Ordinance amongst the Jews only in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and no people else; for its said, <hi>He gave his Statutes and his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Israel,</hi> to every Nation he did not so; but I am no <hi>Jew,</hi> therefore not under that Law, but rather of the stock of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (as is believed) and Tything among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> I never yet read of; and Christ the end of the Law for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness sake (and the Heart and Life of what the Law figured out) being come, neither <hi>Jews</hi> nor <hi>Gentiles</hi> ought to be any longer under Shadows and Figures, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But again, when their claiming of Ttyhes by vertue of the Mosaical Laws is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and will not hold plea <hi>Jure Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> (as they say) then they betake them to another, that is, <hi>Jure humano,</hi> or <hi>The Civil Laws of this Nation,</hi> by which Laws, say they, Tythes is established and setled to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:206439:57"/> them (say the Priests) by vertue of their Place and Office) as a most competent livelihood for them and their Families: In answer whereunto I say, that the radix and grand original property of this Title and Claim did and doth still arise from the Mosaical or Levitical Law, (which is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anulled and done away in Christ, as is before proved) and hence they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a Spiritual propriety, and therefore a (pretended) Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Law and Court is kept and appointed (by Episcopal Authority, within their several Jurisdictions, distinct from the Civil Laws) only for the trial and recovery of Tythes, and such other matters as they account Spiritual; and this Levitical Institution is the sole Basis and Foundation upon which their Civil Law depends, &amp; the Foundation being taken away the Structure or Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falls; so that being disanull'd in Christ, the Civil Law hath no more power, so that the Title of Tythes is lost.

               </gap>hatsoever; so that of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>al Civil Injunction, but they are there called Spiritual Gifts belonging to holy Church, and because many doth deny the payment, &amp;c. so this Act doth but enjoyn the payment of them; as a supposed due and right formerly belonging to holy Church; and therefore doth but (at the utmost) repair, strengthen and preserve that which was like to decay, but doth not set up any new structure, property or title; so the reasons of this Law being taken away (which is, that they are a supposed due) this Act is nulled.</p>
            <p>These before mentioned being the only main Grounds and Reasons whereupon Tythes are claimed and payed, which I hope is satisfactorily answered; indeed, some more frivilous Objections are made; (as, what will not many say to save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves when they are in an exigent? yea, brawl, menace, perhaps beat with wicked fist, revile or scoff, and it may be set an Officer on one, and hale him before a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:206439:58"/> &amp;c.) I say many more they make to little purpose, as that in <hi>Luke</hi> 18. where the <hi>Pharisee</hi> payed Tythes of all he posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, which hath little in it, unless they would be condemned (with him) as a <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee</hi> with their outside holiness: others say, <hi>Thou shalt not muzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the Corn;</hi> I say so too; if they be Oxen let them be unmuzled, and live of what they tread out, which is so little that they never durst rely upon it yet, but they are more idle then such Oxen, &amp;c. this is like their plowing in hope, and sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in hope, which for the most part fails before they either plow or sow; for in which of the Priests did ever the hope en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure until he reaped the fruit of his plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or sowing? but rather first he must know what stipend there is, what Tythes or Grebe-lands, or other Revenue belongs to the incombent, and how it doth arise; this you may say is too true: Again, say they, <hi>He that gathers a Flock, let him eat of the milk of the Flock;</hi> (indeed so say I) but they either get no flock gathered, or else their Flock is barren, and gives no milk, or otherwise the milk they give doth not satisfie, which makes them pull, tug and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:206439:58"/> draw so hard for milk, meat and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from others pertaining to another Flock which they never gathered, as daily experience teacheth to their shame, and to the shame of all that are gathered by them: Again, (say they) <hi>If we have sown unto you Spiritual things, is it a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if we reap your Carnal things?</hi> I say its no great matter, but rather the part and duty of a Christian; but to whom have they sown Spirituals? I am sure not to me, for L. W. hath ministred nothing to me, but that which is earthly, and savours of death, (as I have elsewhere said) which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves not my Carnals, nor any other main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from me; not that I am strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed, or so knit and joyned to the things the Lord hath endued me with, but I can distribute them freely to such as sow Spirituals, and ministers freely from the Mouth of the Lord, or to any other in necessity; but <hi>L. W.</hi> (as is well known) hath no such necessity, for all his eager pursuit after my Carnals these Three or four years last past; but he hath coveted an evil covetousness, to set his nest on high, but thereby hath not delivered his Soul from the power of evil, but hath consulted confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to his shame.</p>
            <pb n="116" facs="tcp:206439:59"/>
            <p>So still I say the grand Title stood in the Mosaical Institutions, all which pointed at Christ, and Christ being come, they fall flat, and to them a period is set; for its evident for some hundreds of years after Christ, their was neither Claim nor Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tythes, nor no setling or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining of Ministers to such and such Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes or Places, but they that received freely, preached freely, and went from one Country to another, and from one people to another, as they were drawn by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord; and in those dayes th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se was no setled nor forced maintenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed unto them, but they who received Spirituals, and were brought into the Faith and Fellewship of the Saints they admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred of their Temporals freely without any injunction, (as many hath done in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> these late years) and the Lord having opened the hearts of many (as <hi>Lydia</hi>) they called them into their House, being open to distribute to their necessities; so that they that set forth without money or scrip, &amp;c. wanted nothing: yea, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve many of the Lords Ministers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (called Quakers) hath travelled (in these late years) many hundred of miles,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:206439:59"/> from one people and Nation to another, having been persecuted, and beat, and haled to Prison, and out of Prison, here and there amongst a strange Nation and People which they knew not, who when they set forth could not assure themselves of one nights lodging, or one meals meat, and yet they were in every place sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for, and had no want, they only cast their care upon the Lord, and lived upon the Gospel, being preachers of it, and by the Faith of the Son of God, as did the Primitive Christians in the Apostles dayes, and some hundred of years after, until the Power of Christianity was lost, and the Apostacy crept in, and then they fell into Forms and Immitations, <hi>Rome</hi> being the leading Church setled Bishops, Vicars and Priests, and erected Monastreys, Abbeys and Religious Houses, and placed them there, and brought in the old Rites and Customs of the Jews again, (under a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Zeal and Piety) perswading the People to give gifts to pious uses; so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning them to one thing after another, until their Traditions were received as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, and amongst the rest brought in this of Tythes again, which for a long time
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:206439:60"/> was payed at the Owners pleasure, either to the poor, or to the aforesaid Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Religious Houses for pretended Spiritual uses; and when they saw that the greater part distributed their Tythes to the poor, Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third did restrain the peoples freedoms, <hi>Anno</hi> 1180. And Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> ordained that Tythes should not be distributed to the poor, but to the Mother Church, <hi>Anno</hi> 1274. And Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth ordained the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tythes upon penalty of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication by a Council at <hi>Trent,</hi> about the year 1560. And thus they crept in again, (as they fell from the Power of Godliness) then they began to build again that which was before destroyed, and so brought in these old Ordinances again, in immitation of the Mosaical Law, and so came to force and compel a Maintenance (for a Priesthood and Ministry which was not of <hi>Levi</hi>'s Linnage) which was never used nor known amongst the Christians in the purity of the Gospel; but being little acquainted or read in the State of the Church as it did descend from the Primitive times downwards to this day, I shall be more sparing in things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:206439:60"/> pertaining, and for the further sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction therein, (and how <hi>Rome,</hi> and other Churches, fell from their Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive purity, and how they brought in Tythes and the Relicks of Judaism again) and every external extant Ordinance or Tradition now allowed and established throughout all <hi>Europe</hi>) I refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>A. Pearson</hi>'s Book, called, <hi>The Great Case of Tything,</hi> and also to <hi>Francis How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill</hi>'s Books, the one, called, <hi>The Glory of the True Church Discovered in its Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> where he proves Tythes no Gospel Ordinance; the other, called, <hi>The Great Case of Tything once more Revived, &amp;c.</hi> where the State of the Church in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, and downward from year to year, and the bringing in of all the <hi>Romish</hi> Stuff, and Superstitious Trash is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated of, and may be satisfactory to any sober Reader that desires to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed.</p>
            <p>Now it appears clear, that that Law by which Tythes was payable and due under the First Covenant was only established among the <hi>Jews,</hi> (as I said before) and that in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> being a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people, to whom he gave his Laws
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:206439:61"/> and his Statutes for ever, as its said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147.19. and its believed we are not of the <hi>Jews</hi> Genealogy, neither of the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of any of the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Flesh; and therefore (if Tythes were yet an Ordinance in force) as to the contrary is sufficiently proved) ought not to be paid by us by vertue of that Law and Covenant, we being of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Stock by Nature, (is authentical) and so hath nothing to do with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of <hi>Israel</hi> according to the Flesh, who was the natural Branches unto whom pertained the Law, and the Covenant, and the Oracles of God, and they fell through unbelief, and by their fall we came to be ingrafted, and we <hi>stand by Faith, which is the Gift of God, a Mystery held in a pure Conscience,</hi> and not by the observation of the Ordinances of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the First Covenant: So let the blind Priests and Doctors lay their hands upon their mouthes, and be ashamed of their gross absurdity, and stupid Sences being mudled and jumbled in obscurity with their many Arts and Sciences, multiplicity of Tongues, and divided Languages, one pleading one thing, and another pleading another, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:206439:61"/> they become like Froth upon the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which while not touched appears material and substantial, but if once hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led wasteth and vanisheth away; so doth their windy deformed Doctrine, and typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tenents, who hath long preached and talked of a Covenant of Grace, which is still a Mystery, or as a Book Sealed to them while they are studdying and musing in their Greek and Latine Libraries, not at all perceiving the Vail, or the Wall of Partition that stands between them and the Covenant of Grace unbroken down and removed.</p>
            <p>One other Objection is in my mind, which is this, speaking of <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> who received the Tenth of the Spoils from <hi>Abraham,</hi> its said, <hi>Levi, who received Tythes payed Tythes in Abraham;</hi> and further he saith, <hi>Here men that die receive Tythes; but there he received them of whom it is Witnessed that he liveth;</hi> now, what objection can be made from these words, <hi>Here men that die receive Tythes, but there, &amp;c?</hi> the words hath relation to two times or places, or as <hi>here</hi> or <hi>there;</hi> as <hi>here</hi> in this time, and <hi>there</hi> in that time; for the Law being 430 years after
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:206439:62"/>
               <hi>Abraham,</hi> or after the Promise was made to <hi>Abraham, Galat.</hi> 3.17. must needs be nearer to the Apostle, or to the dayes of the Apostle, then the day that <hi>Abraham</hi> gave the Tenth of the Spoil to <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck,</hi> by so many years; so that he might well say <hi>here</hi> when he spoke of the Sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> and <hi>there</hi> when he spoke of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedeck;</hi> but if any say it hath relation to the very Age and Day when the Apostle spoke it, (which is disputable) yet I may say now as he said then, Here men that die receive Tythes (yea such as are dead while they live) and not onely receive Tythes, but persecute, imprison, and in a manner rob for Tythes such as doth not give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law or Custom, but I allow not such: I may say here Ministers in <hi>England</hi> Swear, Lye, Covet, Oppress and Persecute exceedingly for Tythes, and yet pretend to be Gospel Ministers; but I say again, I allow not such, neither believe they are Gospel Ministers; so this makes little (in my judgment) for Tythes under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: Then again, <hi>there he received Tythes</hi> (viz. <hi>Melchisedeck) of whom it is witnessed that he liveth;</hi> and Christ is said <hi>to be a Priest for ever after the Order of</hi> Melchse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:206439:62"/> Now if any infer from hence that Tythes or First-fruits belongs to Christ, as being, or coming in <hi>Melchisedeck</hi>'s Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; I say, rather it hath reference to his immutability and unchangableness, then taking of Tythes; for its said, <hi>He was without descent, without beginning or end of dayes;</hi> and if it related to Tythes; first, I say to that, it was but the Tenths of the Spoils, and not of all his Estate and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, clean and unclean, as they are now claimed: And secondly, I hope you'll grant Christ a Spiritual Priest, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if any will give, it must be the First-fruits and Tenths of things Spiritual, and not Carnal, else there is no agreement nor coherence; <hi>For Sacrifice and Offerings he would not,</hi> for he being Spiritual accepts nothing but what is Spiritual, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the measure of his own Spirit and Truth in every one; and herein let as many offer and give unto the Lord as will, and as much, and as often as they will, I allow of it, if it be a Spiritual Offering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <p>Thus much in Defence of my Innocent Suffering, being thus far convinced in my
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:206439:63"/> Judgment, and perswaded in my Heart and Conscience, I dare not allow not yield to anything so noxious to my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and contrary to the Gospel Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation and the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus, being (as is before proved) in the first place figurative, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed for the time then present, until the time of Reformation: Secondly, being only an Ordinance among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and such as were under the Law, and not to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> nor such as are under the Gospel. Thirdly, being claimed as Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual by Divine Institution, when as the extent and scope of the Institution is finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ended, and is therefore now no more Spiritual then the rest of the nine parts. And lastly, being generally dedicated, payed and received for the use and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of an Antichristian, dark Man-made Ministry, who only seeks ours, and not us; for which, the wisest and learnedst of them can neither produce precept nor president from Christ, or any other his Apostles, Ministers and Servants in the Primitive purity of the Church, being an old Ordinance of <hi>Moses</hi> renovated in the <hi>Romish</hi> Apostacy, and Traditionally dispers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               </gap>y appear in those pithy and ponderous works of the before recited Authors <hi>A. F.</hi> and <hi>F. H.</hi> this Title of Tythes having such a pleasant delightsom relish, it hath been still retained amongst all the Reformed Rulers in Church and State, who hath so largely professed to cast off the Papisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Yoke.</p>
            <p>Now I shall proceed to say something to those my Neighbours and Parishoners, amongst whom I have had my conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in times past, and a society when I wrought the will of the Flesh, who have known my manner of life from a child; I say to such, what have I done? what have I thought? what have I acted or spoken that hath deserved any such measure as I have received from <hi>L. W?</hi> or what evil have I done? or what occasion have I given to any mans person, good name or estate at any time? especially since I associated amongst the People called Quakers, let him, you, or any of you, or any other person come forth, that can justly charge any thing against me, wherein I have dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:206439:64"/> any one the value of a penny, and have denied to give satisfaction, or have offered violence to any one ones Dog, and I shall willingly (upon due proof) make acknowledgment and satisfaction to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of my power; for blessed be the Lord my Righteousness and Redeemer, there is no thing upon my Conscience and spirit, but what is between the Lord and my own soul in matter of my Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; yea, everlastingly magnified be the Righteous Lord my Preserver, to whose praise I desire to speak it, that though <hi>L. W.</hi> and many others have sought occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and have waited for my halting or falling, they have not yet seen it, nor got no occasion against me (save about the Law and Worship of my God, or the holding forth my Testimony and exercise of my Conscience towards him, for which I have been reviled, mocked and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst you; yea, the Children in the Streets have played upon me with their tongues; this I speak to their (or their Parents) shame, but was as joy and rejoycing to my Soul, being for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness sake, the Blessing of the Lord was with me, and mine Enemies knew it not,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:206439:64"/> nor they that dwelt in darkness saw it not.</p>
            <p>This further I have to propound to you, whether ye can allow of it? or that it would be justifiable in the Law of Equity and true Judgment, that my Servant should sue you at Law, make spoil, and carry away your goods, and cast your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons into Prison, and after all seek to make your estates forfeit and confiscate, and all for the wages and recompence of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he hath done for me? which of you would approve of such work, or of me in keeping such a Servant? I would you not rather say to me, if I have hired a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and imployed him, pay him and maintain him also; why doth he trouble you? what have you to do to pay him for my work, seeing he is my Servant? Is not this the case between me and you? Is not <hi>L. W.</hi> your Minister, and also your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant? And by what Law or Reason ought I to pay him for doing your service? Hath either you or he a president in all the Scriptures of any such unequal deeds? Did ye ever read of any of the Churches, or Servants of God in Ages past that used such things? I trow not; If I had distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:206439:65"/> voluntarily it had been one thing, but being sued and compelled thereunto, therefore I complain; may not I say to you, why do you hire more Servants then you can pay? Or why do you keep more then you are able to maintain? Else, why am I thus persecuted for his maintenance? May not I speak this to your shame? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so many (as I may say) for one Servant, you are either hard Masters, and very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurious and strait-handed to your Servants, or else your Servants are very <hi>lavish, proud, profane</hi> and <hi>prodigal,</hi> and hath <hi>much maintaining:</hi> Did ever any Minister of ours (called a <hi>Quaker</hi>) come among you to sue &amp; cast into Prison for their Maintenance and livelihood? or what would you say if they should? I believe you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn both us and them; and indeed we should be greatly ashamed, if they should; for my part, I had rather administer to the last mite, then any such cause of aspersion should be given against us, and also testifie against them as no Ministers of Christ that preaches for any such ends; if they be Gospel Ministers, let their Gospel main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, or let them labour with their hands; though many have said, we are a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:206439:65"/> disorderly and unmannerly People; but I affirm we have better orders and manners amongst us then you have; for your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are become your Masters, and Lords it over you, and both in that, and many other things, disorder and confusion is come over you, as they that built <hi>Babel</hi> of old.</p>
            <p>I remember well what <hi>Malachi</hi> saith, complaining of the Priests, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.2, 3, &amp;c. to verse 9. <hi>I will send a Curse upon you, I'll Curse your Blessings; yea, I have Cursed them already: Behold, I'll eorrupt your Seed, and spread dung upon your Faces, and ye shall know that I have sent this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment unto you, that my Covenant might be with</hi> Levi; <hi>my Covenant was with him of Life and Peace, the Law of Truth was in his Mouth; for the Priests Lips should preserve knowledge; but ye are departed out of the Way, ye have caused many to stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the Law; ye have corrupted the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of</hi> Levi, (saith he) <hi>therefore have I made you contemptible and base before all the People.</hi> [Mark, now] Is not this the case and condition of the present Priesthood and Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> those neutralists, that are neither Ministers of the Law nor
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:206439:66"/> Gospel? hath not the Lord made them contemptible and base before all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yea, where shall a man come and have any discourse about them, but the most part, if not all, doth generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they are covetous, vile, proud and profane persons, Oppressors, Drunkards, Men-pleasers, Time-servers, Turn-coats, Heady and High-minded, <hi>lovers of pleasures and filty lucre more then of God, having a Form of Godliness, but denying the Power; but their folly shall be,</hi> (and is) <hi>made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, it shall proceed no further,</hi> said the Apostle.</p>
            <p>May not I say the Merchants of this last Age hath exceeded all that ever went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, they can trade on those dayes called their Sabboths, or Lords-dayes, and prohibit all others from either trading or labouring in their lawfull and honest voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (but if they'll Play, Drink, Revel, Swear, and be Profane, there they may have liberty enough) on those dayes? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, whether any have need of their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandice or not, or will come and Trade with them or not, or will take any of their Commodities from them or not; yet they have a Law, and by that Law
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:206439:66"/> compel them to pay, and that even their own rates what they demand; and if any refuse, then they'll menace and thunder out their Comminations, and Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, and some they'll cast in Prison, it may be till death, and yet cloke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves over with the name of Gospel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and plead innocency, and say its the Law that requires it, and binds men to be subject to Ecclesiastical Cannons and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; now, wherein doth their innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy appear, unless in putting a white Coat above a black one, a Popish dress? and if the Figure be true, they are but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side <hi>Pharisees,</hi> appearing white and clean without, and that in apparel only: Yea, I may say they are as expert wise Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (in that <hi>Babilonish</hi> wisdom) as ever Trafficked or Sailed upon the Waters of the Great Whore, they can Sail with any Wind that blows within the Circuit of <hi>Babylons</hi> Coasts; but that Prophesie comes to be fulfilled upon them, <hi>Evil men and Seducers shall wax worse and worse, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and being deceived, &amp;c.</hi> But blessed be the Lord the Day is dawned that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares them, and the Light that makes them manifest, with their all Abominations,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:206439:67"/> and the Son is appeared that will disperse them as the morning mist, so that their skirts shall be uncovered, and their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness shall be laid open, and their visage shall be no more vailed, for the Judgment of the Great Whore is come and coming, wherein all her Merchants shall weep and mourn, because no man buyeth their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandice any more.</p>
            <p>So this Mite of my Testimony I have cast in, being but a Mite indeed in comparison of the many weighty, praise-worthy works, given forth by many of the dear and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Servants of God upon this very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in this very Age, from the breakings forth of the glorious Light in them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and made known; And for the clearing my Conscience in the sight of the Lord, I refer this to publick view, and give this Testimony to my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Acquaintance, or any others that yet see not the difference between us and the Priests in this very point; and partly for satisfying or silencing of others, especially the People of the <hi>Independants,</hi> or Congregational Church at <hi>Melmerby,</hi> (so called) who though (as I have said before) they once made the non pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:206439:67"/> of Tythes an Article of their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet have of late (since I became a Sufferer for them) whisperingly or clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinely condemned me in secret more then many (if not all) others that have less profession, and seem more profane, rendring me foolish, and unwise to suffer so much, and so long for such a trivial, external, tempory matter, as they call it; but to me it was and is no small matter, being to the contrary perswaded in my Conscience, and knowing by good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and assured Testimonies, that I must stand or fall by obedience or diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the manifestation of the Lords precious Gift and Light in my own Soul and Conscience; I therefore value not the Judgment of any Man, or People, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Light, the Line of True Judgment, and Rule of Life to me) and to be accounted a Fool is no new nor strange thing, for a Fool I am to their wisdom, as was the good and precious Servants of God in Ages past, <hi>For the Wisdom of God is foolishness with men;</hi> and casting things upon me behind my back, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes them not, it were more Christian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for them to admonish, or instruct me
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:206439:68"/> face to face, and to give me their advice and reasons in matters of this nature, which if I found to be more weighty, sound, and agreeable to the Witness of God in my Conscience, I should be very ready, willing and glad to receive them, and be informed by them; I am neither so far remote, nor so much a Stranger to them, (though my Principle may) but this way they chuse not, but makes war and fights as men that beat the Air hiddenly, or afar off, slighting and contemning my Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and me for its sake, above most of People, as though I had been poysonous and infectious where I came, prohibiting some of their Society, (and Members so called) to have any fellowship or converse with me, or to receive either Books or Papers from me, or come where I was; and one of their leading Teachers (<hi>G. Nicholson</hi> by name) denied to make good their own Principles and Tenents, held forth in their own defence against us; and also to make good several contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious aspertions cast upon us (in my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) by him and others; and also denied to give an account of his faith and hope in Christ Jesus, saying, <hi>It was in vain, &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:206439:68"/> with several such like matters which I shall now omit; and yet these People will be slighting and villifying us in secret; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we have much more cause to have dis-esteemed them and their Principles, having more knowledge of both them and it, when we were amongst them, then ever they had of us or ours; and in vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying our Principles they speak evil of things they understand not, being a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure whose worth and value they never knew, the mystery whereof is hid and seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that state and nature they live in; we have known theirs, but they never knew ours; yea, for my own part I can truely say in the Light and Presence of the Lord, that I had more love and affection in my heart for those people, then any other Profession that was from the Light; yea, many a time I could have mourned in secret, &amp; been willing to have undergone great hardship that they might have been won and gained to the Lord; yea, I could, as it were, have plucked them out of the fire many a time; other times my spirit hath been weighed and burthened, yea, filled with indignation against some of them that were Elders, Teachers and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:206439:69"/> Leaders that caused the rest to err, who like the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of old, have <hi>shut the Kingdom of God,</hi> as it were; but I am sure they have drawn backward and hindred the Work of the Lord, both in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others; for <hi>they would neither enter themselves, nor suffer those that would,</hi> but have made war against the Light in themselves and others; and I testifie they are Strangers to the Covenant of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, Christ Jesus the Light, the New and Living Way, who is the Light of the World, <hi>John</hi> 8.12. <hi>Who is in the World, and the World knows him not, and lighteth every man that comes into the World,</hi> John 1.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. unto whom <hi>John</hi> came to bear witness, and yet how few will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? how few doth receive <hi>John</hi>'s Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, though he was sent from God to bear witness of the Light? and all hold <hi>John</hi> as a Prophet; also, how few do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christs own Exhortation, who said, <hi>While you have the Light believe in the Light, that you may be Children of the Light,</hi> John 12.36. no marvel if they receive not ours? may it not well be said unto them, <hi>Behold ye Dispisers and wonder, I will work a Work in your day, which
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:206439:69"/> though a man declare it unto you, yet will you in no wise believe,</hi> Acts 13.41. [Mark] ye Despisers that despise the Light, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it as as a thing of nought, (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it Natural, or Diabolical, or an unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing) esteeming it too mean a meat for your stuffed up stomacks, and cannot yet be digested by you; what better Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony would you have? would you have one arise from the dead? here's <hi>John</hi> a man sent from God, and here's Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus which rose from the dead, which death could not hold; also we have the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Spirit of Truth, <hi>and having received this Testimony, we have the Witness in our selves, and can set to our Seals that God is true,</hi> John 3.35. and that there is no other way to the Father, but by Christ Jesus the Light, which is the Life and Blood of the everlasting Covenant, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny set it at nought, and will not stoop to so small a thing, yet all the Powers of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness cannot comprehend it, it will break thorow them all to your condemnation that are disobedient; and for proof there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I appeal to every of your Consciences in the sight of God, and let the Light therein, <hi>which abideth in you, which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:206439:70"/> is Truth and no Lye,</hi> John 2.27. let it declare for me whether any of you can hide you from it; <hi>If you take the Wings of the Morning</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> said) <hi>and fly into the uttermost parts of the Earth, it will find you out;</hi> do what you will it will declare the nature of your deeds; when you do evil at home or abroad, never so secretly, when no man sees, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you, and when you do well it will justifie, and you will feel peace and joy in that work; it will tell you all that ever you did, as the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> said, <hi>Is not this the Christ, come and see;</hi> then they came and saw and believed also, not because of her words, but by what they heard from him themselves, saying, <hi>they knew indeed that this is the very Christ,</hi> John 4.42. So be intreated (as a man would intreat his Friend whom he loveth) to come with the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not so as we have said; she was but one, and that a woman, yet they came forth with her to see if it was he, and it was he, and they believed; but we are many Witnesses, and testifie what we have heard, and seen, and handled of him: So once more (I say) be intreated to come
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:206439:70"/> and see; not to come forth after us, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us, as he said, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.21, 23. but to turn in your minds (I mean) to the Light of Christ Jesus in your own hearts, <hi>for the Kingdom of Heaven is within you,</hi> and there hearken to him that is the Light of the World; (Mark, the World is set in mans heart, <hi>Eceles.</hi> 3.11.) and when you have heard and obeyed, (for that is believing indeed) I question not but you will be ready to say with the <hi>Samaritans, That ye know that he is indeed the very Christ.</hi> So put not off by delays, but while the Lord calls do you answer, and while he seeks be you gathered, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, 26. yea, <hi>while the Light and Love of God is with you believe in it, receive it, and walk in it; for darkness comes when no man shall walk or work,</hi> Joh. 22.35, 36. <hi>And the Light of the wicked shall be put out, and the Spark of his fire shall be quenched,</hi> Job. 18.5, 6. <hi>Then shall his Wrath and Fury increase, which will torment the Conscience for ever, where they shall feel the Worm that dies not, and the Fire that never goes out; then Sorrow, Mourning and bitter Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation shall fall upon them; then may they cry to the Mountains fall on us, and to the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:206439:71"/> Hills to cover us;</hi> even they (I mean) that slighted their day of their Visitation, and hate to be reformed; <hi>For behold the dayes come that shall burn as an Oven, wherein all the proud, and all that do wickedly shall be as stubble; the day that cometh shall burn them up, and shall leave them neither Root nor Branch; but to them that fear my Name, saith the Lord, shall the Sun of Righteousness arise with healing in his Wings, and they shall go forth and grow as Calves in the stall; and they shall tread down the wicked; yea, the wicked shall be as Ashes under the soles of their feet, in that day when I shall do this saith the Lord;</hi> he that can believe it let him.</p>
            <p>This is my Testimony given forth in the same Love wherewith the Lord my God hath loved me, not desiring to eat my morsel alone, nor yet to conceal the loving-kindness of the Lord, (which is held forth freely unto all) of which I am made a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, according to the measure of that Grace and Love received in Christ Jesus, who would not that any should perish, but that all men might come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth and be saved; who was the First-fruits of Righteousness, leaving us an Example to follow his steps: So de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:206439:71"/> that all might come to partake of the same Grace with us, and walk in the same Light with us, where there is no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of stumbling; and come to drink of the same Living Water with us, which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever drinketh thereof shall never thirst again, but is satisfied for ever; this none knows save they that drink thereof, and they are but a few.</p>
            <p>Having, for the Reasons aforesaid, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this to publick view, its now other mens (as well as mine) to judge of, and no doubt may be by some opposed, as well as by others approved; I therefore desire the discreet Reader (having soberly and piously pondered this short Treatise, in the fear of the Lord) not rashly to asperse either me or it behind my back, thereby to make my Principle or Testimony odious in the eyes of such as are weak and unstable in Judgment, but rather (having any thing to object against the Truth of any particular herein) to make known their Objections to me, either by word or writing, and I shall be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willing to be Christianly informed, or else to give a Christian information, and sober Reply for their satisfaction, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:206439:72"/> for the clearing and vindicating of every particular herein, according to that Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of knowledge that is given me to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove; and this I hope will be easily granted by such as is willing to do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me as they would have me (or others) to do unto them, which is according to both Law and Prophets.</p>
